        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Follow these steps to create the perfect biscuits:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to <b>425°F (220°C)</b>.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the <i>flour</i>, <i>baking powder</i>, and <i>salt</i>.</li>
            <li>Add the cold, diced butter and use a pastry cutter or your hands to mix until the texture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the milk, stirring gently, until a soft dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it 8-10 times. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</li>
            <li>Roll or pat the dough to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Use a biscuit cutter (or a round glass) to cut out biscuits.</li>
            <li>Place the biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet, leaving a little space between each one.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown. <sup>2nd</sup> batch might take slightly less time.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, let cool slightly, and enjoy warm with your favorite toppings!</li>
